# Changelog

Releases of the self-hosted container image (`ghcr.io/kingchappers/hoardwise`; releases up to 0.2.0 were published as `ghcr.io/kingchappers/budget-app-v3-ai-edition`). Versions follow `vX.Y.Z` tags; `edge` is the latest `main` and is not a release. See "Upgrading" in [docs/SELF-HOSTING.md](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md) before you update, and take a backup first.

## Unreleased

Not in the image yet, or not part of it:

- **Browser demo.** A separate static build of the app with an invented household, running entirely in the visitor's browser. It is published at https://demo.hoardwise.xyz (the original https://demo.budget.scgrid.xyz keeps working for now) and is not part of the container image.
- **Brand kit.** The app has its logo, icons, favicons, link-preview image and Lora typeface, and a green and gold palette in light and dark mode. The lockup is in the header, the sign-in screens and the demo banner.
- **Personal API tokens.** The API accepts personal access tokens. They are read-only by default, with optional write tokens (self-hosted write tokens need your password), expire after 90, 180, 365 or 730 days or never, can be revoked, and are all revoked by a password reset. Create and revoke them under Settings > Access tokens.
- **API description.** `docs/openapi.yaml` describes every route (OpenAPI 3.1); tests fail if it drifts from the code.
- **API docs.** Logged-in users can read the API reference in the app on the Docs page (Settings > API docs). The same description is served at `GET /api/openapi.json` and a guide for AI agents at `GET /api/docs/agents`, both behind login or an access token. The browser demo does not include them.
- **Agent skill.** A Claude Code plugin, installable from this repository, teaches an agent to review your month through the API in a calm, short way, and to log a spend when you ask.
- **Weekly image scan.** The published `latest` and `edge` images are scanned for high and critical vulnerabilities every Monday.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-27

The app is now called **Hoardwise**.

- **The image is renamed** to `ghcr.io/kingchappers/hoardwise`. Update the `image:` line in your compose file; see "Upgrading" in `docs/SELF-HOSTING.md`. The old name `ghcr.io/kingchappers/budget-app-v3-ai-edition` keeps its existing tags (`0.1.0`, `0.2.0`, `latest`) but gets no further updates.
- The repository is now `kingchappers/hoardwise`; the old address redirects.
- **Self-hosted sign-in cookie renamed.** The session cookie is now `hoardwise_session` (`__Host-hoardwise_session` over HTTPS), so everyone signs in once more after updating.
- **Database and backup names.** New installs create `hoardwise.sqlite` and `hoardwise-…` backups. An install that already has `budget.sqlite` keeps using it, and older `budget-…` backups are still kept, restored and pruned. Nothing is renamed on disk.
- **Saved browser settings** (preferences, snoozed bills and similar) move to new names the first time the app loads, with nothing lost.
- **Rolling back.** If you go back to a version before 0.3.0 after updating, you sign in again and settings changed since the update (browser preferences) are not carried back. An install that kept its `budget.sqlite` is untouched by going back. A brand-new 0.3.0 install has `hoardwise.sqlite`, so it cannot be taken back to a version before 0.3.0 without its data being left behind in that file.
- Apart from the `image:` line, nothing else is needed on upgrade: your data, backups and account carry over.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-17

Made the image workable on hosts that give you no shell, such as PikaPods.

- **Password recovery without a shell.** Create an empty file named `RESET_PASSWORD` in the data folder and restart. The app deletes it, signs everyone out, clears any login lock-out and logs a one-time recovery code (also saved as `SETUP_CODE.txt`). Entering that code on the sign-in page sets a new password; your account and data are unchanged.
- **Setup and recovery codes** appear in the log and in `SETUP_CODE.txt` (owner-only, removed once used).
- **`TRUST_PROXY`** accepts only `true` or `false`.
- Documentation for running on a managed host, including where to find the log and the data folder.
- Database schema: unchanged from 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-17

First release of the self-hosting image.

- The app and its API in one container for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, running as a non-root user.
- SQLite storage in `/data`, with an automatic daily backup.
- Built-in single-account login, so no Auth0 account is needed.
- Optional automatic HTTPS (set `TLS_DOMAIN`), or plain HTTP behind your own reverse proxy.
- Licensed AGPL-3.0-or-later.
